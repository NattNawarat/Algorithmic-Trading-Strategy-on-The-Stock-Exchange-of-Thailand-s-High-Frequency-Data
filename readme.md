# Algorithmic Trading Strategy on The Stock Exchange of Thailandâ€™s High Frequency Data

This research project is about designing stock price prediction and algorithmic trading strategy on 
high-frequency data by constructing mean-reversion time series based on historical prices of all stock in a defined sector and statistical tests, 
including Johanson cointegration, Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, and Hurst Exponent
and applying Half-Life of Mean-Reversion to detect and predict prices movement to design a trading strategy

Please store Stock's price in "OHLC_5m" directory and name file with this format "{Stock's name}_5T.csv or .pkl"

data_cleaner.py and data_reader.py was design to handle with author's data which cannot be shown in the public. Hence,may not work with your data you have to find the way for data_reader.py to return dataframe of OHLC price in 5 minute interval according to your data. (you can ignore data_cleaner.py.)
